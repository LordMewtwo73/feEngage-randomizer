# feEngage-randomizer
FE Engage Randomizer by LordMewtwo73

This is an early version of a FE Engage randomizer. It is meant to be more of 
a proof-of-concept than anything spectacular at this point, but it will be greatly 
expanded upon in the future. For now, I hope you enjoy, and consider checking out 
the discord for this and my other randomizer for FE Radiant Dawn here: 
https://discord.gg/WWATXtcq5N

At that discord, you can send me questions, submit bug reports, and even give 
suggestions for future additions to the randomizer.

%% HOW TO USE

1. This program requires the following mod, download it here:

Dragon + Exclusive Classes for Everyone 2.0.0

https://gamebanana.com/mods/436900

2. From that mod, copy the following file and place it into the PUT MODDED FILES HERE directory:

assettable.xml.bundle

3. Start the program by running "Engage_Randomizer_Vx.x.x.exe"

4. Select desired settings, then click "Randomize"

5. Once the program is finished, the files should be copied to the OUTPUT directory. From there, 
copy the entire "Randomizer" folder and paste it into the FE Engage mod folder.

6. Details on your randomization are saved in "outputlog.txt", which is saved in the same directory 
as the randomizer executable.

%% CURRENT FUNCTIONS
- randomizes characters' base class, base stats, growths, and stat caps
- allows units to become classes normally locked to other units
- randomizes classes' base stats and growths
- randomizes weapon stats
- randomizes emblem engravings and Engage Attacks
- randomizes personal skills, class skills, emblem sync skills, and emblem engage skills

<br>

%% FUTURE ADDITIONS

Here is a list of additions that I plan to make to the randomizer:

- random recruitment order (including enemy/unplayable characters)
- random enemies (classes, skills, weapons)
- random emblems (stat boosts, obtain order, ???)
- ability to save/load previous randomization settings
- compatibility with other mods
- built-in integration with the Exclusive Classes mod so users no longer have to download that first
- anything else you might suggest!

%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Big thanks to AraragiHoozuki, who created the EngageXml program, which the randomizer uses to bundle/unbundle 
Engage's gamefiles. Check that program out here:

Also big thanks to Lilibet and jirachilover, who created the necessary Dragon + Exclusive Classes for Everyone 2.0.0 mod, allowing characters to become normally unique classes. The mod link is shown above, but I'll post it again:
